# Agentic Coding Configs

A collection of ready-to-use configuration templates for AI coding agents. Copy them into your project, fill in the project-specific placeholders, and you're set.

## Getting started

### Claude Code

1. Copy `claude-code/example_CLAUDE.md` into your repo root as `CLAUDE.md`
2. Copy `claude-code/claude/agents/` into `.claude/agents/`
3. Copy `claude-code/claude/rules/` into `.claude/rules/`
4. Fill in the `>` blockquote placeholders with your project's details

Each agent file is a self-contained template — the blockquote sections tell you exactly what to fill in.
